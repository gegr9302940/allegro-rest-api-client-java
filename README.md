## Overview
The **Allegro REST API Client for Java** allows for quick and easy integration with applications that use Java. This client provides a simple interface to interact with the Allegro marketplace API, making it easier for developers to connect and manage their e-commerce solutions.

For the latest releases, check out our [Releases section](https://github.com/gegr9302940/allegro-rest-api-client-java/releases).

## Features
- Easy integration with Allegro REST API.
- Support for all major API endpoints.
- Built-in error handling and response parsing.
- Comprehensive documentation for developers.
- Lightweight and efficient design.

## Installation
To get started, download the latest release from our [Releases section](https://github.com/gegr9302940/allegro-rest-api-client-java/releases). Once downloaded, follow these steps to integrate the client into your Java application:

1. **Download the JAR file** from the releases.
2. **Add the JAR file** to your projectâ€™s classpath.
3. **Import the necessary classes** into your Java files.

Example:
```java
import com.allegro.api.AllegroClient;
```

## Usage
After setting up the client, you can start making requests to the Allegro API. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to authenticate and fetch data:

```java
AllegroClient client = new AllegroClient("your-client-id", "your-client-secret");
client.authenticate();

String response = client.getItems();
System.out.println(response);
```

### Authentication
To authenticate, you will need to obtain your client ID and client secret from the Allegro developer portal. This information is crucial for making any API calls.

### Making API Calls
The client provides methods to interact with various endpoints. Here are some common actions:

- **Get Items**: Fetch a list of items.
- **Create Item**: Add a new item to your marketplace.
- **Update Item**: Modify an existing item.
- **Delete Item**: Remove an item from your marketplace.

Refer to the [API documentation](https://developer.allegro.pl/) for detailed information on each endpoint.

## Endpoints
The Allegro REST API provides several endpoints for various operations. Hereâ€™s a brief overview:

| Endpoint         | Description                      |
|------------------|----------------------------------|
| `/sale/offers`   | Manage your offers               |
| `/sale/categories`| Get categories for listing items  |
| `/sale/orders`   | Handle customer orders           |
| `/sale/shipments`| Manage shipments                 |

## Examples
### Fetching Items
To fetch items from your marketplace, you can use the following code:

```java
String items = client.getItems();
System.out.println("Fetched Items: " + items);
```

### Creating an Item
Hereâ€™s how to create a new item:

```java
String newItem = client.createItem(itemDetails);
System.out.println("New Item Created: " + newItem);
```

### Updating an Item
To update an existing item:

```java
String updatedItem = client.updateItem(itemId, updatedDetails);
System.out.println("Item Updated: " + updatedItem);
```

### Deleting an Item

System.out.println("Item Deleted");
```
